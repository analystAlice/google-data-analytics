## Self-Reflection: Collecting data

You are interviewing for a data analyst role at a local ice cream company. They are interested in using data on customer ice cream flavor preferences to help drive important decisions. 

The hiring manager asks you:

“We want to better understand our customers’ ice cream flavor preferences, but honestly we don’t even know where to start. Would you explain how you would approach this if you were part of our team?”

&nbsp;

**What kind of data should they be gathering?**

> They can collect data about customer's favourite ice cream flavour with parameters like region, gender, age, income level, etc.

**How should they gather this data?**

> They can collect data from customer transaction records, and surveys. They can also in-store monitor and analyze other ice cream shop.

**Where will the data live? How will they store the data?**

> They can use spreadsheet or database software to store their data.

**Once they have the data, how will they use it?**

> Analyze the data, study trends in ice cream flavors, then make business decisions and act on the results.

**How do they keep their data secure and protected?** 

> There are many ways they can secure their customer data, such as using security software, physically locking the hard copy, or storing it in a secure cloud.

**What should they do with old data? What are their options?**

> They can destroy it, but still keep only the data they really need. They can archive it in secured cloud.

## Self-Reflection: Reviewing past concepts

**Explaining the relationship between the data lifecycle and the data analysis process.**

> Data lifecycle is represent of the entire data process in system, starts from creation to its archival and/or destruction, and data analysis process is process to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making using data. 

**Explain the relationship between the "Ask" phase of the data analysis process and the "Plan" phase of the data life cycle?**

> Both data analysis process and data life cycle starts with defining goals, we can achieve them by asking the right questions and making sure we have a clearly defined problem for mapping the processes and resources needed for the entire life cycle.

**Let’s assume we have to change our Data Analysis plan during the middle of the project. Does this mean we will also need to make changes to any decisions we made when defining our data lifecycle?**

> As we redefine the "Plan" phase, we may also have to redefine how we collect, manage and analyze data. Different problems can be solved with different data and methods, but in most cases we don't need to change how we secure, archive and handle old data.
