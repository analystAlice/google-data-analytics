## Notes

* Organizations of all kinds need data analysts to help them improve their processes, identify opportunities and trends, launch new products, provide great customer service, and make thoughtful decisions.
* One of the most exciting parts of being a data analyst is the number of opportunities available. The demand for data analysts is greater than the number of qualified people to fill these job openings.
* The six steps of the data analysis process: 
  * **Ask** questions and define the problem.
  * **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
  * **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.
  * **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
  * **Share** data with your audience.
  * **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.
* **Data scientists** create new questions using data, while **analysts** find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources. 
* To get the most out of data-driven decision-making, it's important to include insights from people who are familiar with the business problem. These people are called **subject matter experts**, and they have the ability to look at the results of data analysis and identify any inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate choices being made. 
* **Gut instinct** is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something conscious; we often pick up on signals without even realizing. You just have a “feeling” it’s right. But for data analysts, just trusting our gut instinct can be a problem. At the heart of data-driven decision making is data, so we always want to focus on the data to ensure that we’re making informed decisions. When we make decisions based on our gut instinct without any data to back it up, it can lead to mistakes. Or worse, when we ignore the data based on our own personal experiences, we can create bias in our analysis. 
* Blending facts and data with your business knowledge will be a common part of your process. The key is figuring out the exact mix of data and business knowledge for each particular project. A lot of times it will depend on the goals of your analysis. That is why analysts often ask, “How do I define success for this project?”
* Successful analysis needs to be accurate, and fast enough to help decision-makers. So try asking yourself these questions about a project:
  * What kind of results are needed?
  * Who will be informed?
  * Am I answering the question being asked?
  * How quickly does a decision need to be made?
* **Data analysis life cycle** is a process of going from data to decision. Data goes through several phases as it gets created, consumed, tested, processed and reused. With a life cycle model, all key team members can drive success by planning work both up front and at the end of the data analysis process. While the data analysis life cycle is well known among experts, there is still no defined structure of those phases.
