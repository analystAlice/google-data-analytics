## Notes

* **Analytical thinking** involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.
* Five key skills in analytical thinking:
  * **Curiosity**, a desire to know more about something, asking the * right questions
  * **Understanding context**, understanding where information fits into the “big picture”
  * **Having a technical mindset**, breaking big things into smaller steps
  * **Data design**, thinking about how to organize data and information
  * **Data strategy**, thinking about the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis 
* Five key aspect of analytical thinking as data analyst:
  * **Visualization**, visual can help data anaylst understand and explain information more effectively.
  * **Strategy**, see what you want to achieve with the data and how you can get there. 
  * **Problem-orientation**, identify, describe, and solve problems.
  * **Correlation**, being identify a correlation between two or more pieces of data. 
  * **Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking**, see the big picture as well as the details and detail-oriented thinking is all about figuring out all of the aspects that will help you execute a plan. 
* It's important to think in different ways because in data analysis, solutions are almost never right in front of you. You need to **think critically** to find out the right questions to ask. But you also need to **think creatively** to get new and unexpected answers.
* **Gap analysis** lets you examine and evaluate how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future. Businesses conduct gap analysis to do all kinds of things, such as improve a product or become more efficient. The general approach to gap analysis is understanding *where you are now* compared to *where you want to be*. Then you can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them.
